# Phishing_URL_Detection

<h1> PHSHING </h1>
The scammer or cyber-criminal uses a URL link to infect the target. The people 
are social and will be very eager to click the link for accepting the friend requests 
and maybe even ready to share their contact such as email. Most of the time email or 
SMS works, hidden links, tiny URL, misspelled URL works as a conduit for such an 
attack Some security threat intelligence companies which detect and publish 
malicious web URL or IPs and provide blacklist database, hence helping in preventing 
the others from the harmful effect of phishing.


<h1> Ways to find out </h1>
The machine learning techniques have been used in our experiment, the lexical
structure of a URL which highlighted how an attacker can morph a URL for the phishing
purpose. In this section, we will discuss data pre-processing techniques for feature
selection and feature extraction for the phishing URL detection problem. The features 
which have generally been used in phishing classification problem can broadly be
grouped infour categories asbelow
<br>
 URL lexicalstructure-basedfeatures<br>
 Domain name related features<br>
 Page based features<br>
The feature extraction is the process of finding the most significant features for the
given problem. The feature extractor first analyses the URL of the website to find the URL
based features. Based on the distinctive points of a URL, we have extracted the following
URL-based features.<br>
 Lengthof the URL<br>
 Number of dots in the URL<br>
 Number of hyphens in the domain<br>
 Presence of security sensitive words in the URL<br>
 Length of the directories in the path of the URL<br>
 Numberof subdirectories in the path of the URL<br>
 Presence or absenceof IP inthe URL<br>
 Countof tokens inthepath<br>
 Largest path token length<br><br>
 Average path token length<br>
 Lengthof thefile<br>
 Totalnumberofdots infile<br>
 Total number of delimiters in file<br>
 Length of arguments<br>
 Number of arguments<br>
 Length of largest argument value<br>
 Maximum number of delimiters in arguments Domain based features<br>
extracted:
 Domain length<br>
 Countof tokens in the domain<br>
 Lengthof largest tokenof largest tokeninthedomain<br>
 Average domain tokenlength<br>
 Suspicious top-level domain Pagerelated features extracted:
 Ageof the domainin month<br>
